                The subject of this thread is an individual found alive on our expedition to Helsingør, seemingly possessing unnatural abilities.
                <br/>
                A more detailed report and a vote regarding the detainment of this individual will be hosted after the interrogations conclude.

                Last night our base was approached by a man similarly possessing extraordinary abilities. We are eagerly awaiting further report

                After crossing the river to Helsingør, a man going by the name of "Gabriel" approached us requesting shelter.
                <br/>
                According to Gabriel, he is an outcast from a distant survivors group, who wandered for two days before finding our group.
                <br/>
                He is a young man of Swedish descent, approximately 192 cm tall, with blonde hair and blue eyes, dressed in full winter gear.
                <br/>
                When he entered the base, his body temperature was measured to be 37.1C, whereas mine was 35.7C
                <br/>
                Later, it was revealed that Gabriel's winter gear was fake, consisting mainly of empty steel frames designed to give the appearance of heavy winter clothing.
                <br/>
                Gabriel is currently silent during his interrogations and does not appear to be responsive to pain. As the council deems him to be in need of immediate detention, the vote will be dismissed.

                We are facing a similar situation.
                <br/>
                Our subject claimed to be tired and in need of sleep, but after checking the cameras the following morning it seems that the subject did not sleep the entire night, instead remaining stationary in a sitting position on their bed.
                <br/>
                Seeing the development of this situation, I will move this discussion to <a href="pages/a-qr-28211979.html"><u>A-qR-2821979</u></a>
