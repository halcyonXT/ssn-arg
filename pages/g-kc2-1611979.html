                This morning I woke up abruptly, feeling lightheaded and nauseous.
                <br/>
                I instantly noticed a distinct metallic smell in the air.
                <br/><br/>
                Are the air filtration systems breaking again or is there a crack/leak? I'm on the top floor of the housing block, nearest to the surface.
                <br/>
                Any other TORQUE residents experience the same?
                <br/><br/>
                Computer lab seems fine, can't say the same about any other rooms. I'll be going to the medical facility for a radiation poisoning checkup

                Bottom floor, I felt nothing the entire day<br/>
                You might need to call the overseer, if its a crack your apartment will need to be quarantined for a while

                If getting to breathe clean air is what you call undesirable then stop complaining about your filtration systems..
