                After crossing the river to Helsingør, a man going by the name of "Gabriel" approached us requesting shelter.
                <br/>
                According to Gabriel, he is an outcast from a distant survivors group, who wandered for two days before finding our group.
                <br/>
                He is a young man of Swedish descent, approximately 192 cm tall, with blonde hair and blue eyes, dressed in full winter gear.
                <br/>
                When he entered the base, his body temperature was measured to be 37.1C, whereas mine was 35.7C
                <br/>
                Later, it was revealed that Gabriel's winter gear was fake, consisting mainly of empty steel frames designed to give the appearance of heavy winter clothing.
                <br/>
                Gabriel is currently silent during his interrogations and does not appear to be responsive to pain. As the council deems him to be in need of immediate detention, the vote will be dismissed.

                Our subject claimed to be tired and in need of sleep, but after checking the cameras the following morning it seems that the subject did not sleep the entire night, instead remaining stationary in a sitting position on their bed.

                There seems to be a clear lack of communication and clarification from the Apollon council here.
                <br/><br/>
                MEDUSA's unnamed individual and Gabriel are clearly not fit to be active members of a survivor station.<br/>
                <br/>
                In the case of Gabriel, his arrival under dubious circumstances and the discovery of his fraudulent winter gear should be a cause for serious concern.
                His deceptive actions with undertones of malice and a clear lack of cooperation paired with a supernatural (?) irresponsiveness to pain are reason enough to keep him detained until we have proper answers.<br/>
                Professor Hellqvist, I sincerely recommend you veto and keep Gabriel detained.
                <br/><br/>
                As for the unnamed individual from MEDUSA I cannot speak much without further detail, but it's clear that a person who is able to stand stationary for several hours on end all while avoiding sleep right after travelling for an unknown amount of time is clearly not in a state of mind to be integrated into a survivor station.<br/>
                Correct me if I'm wrong, but getting to MEDUSA from any previously populated area is quite a trip, not to mention its location is quite obscured.

                I'm giving you, Colton, a warning about the station representative rules. Do not intentionally go against the Apollon council's orders. Regular discussion is fine, but giving recommendations to prof. Hellqvist that explicitly go against APOLLON's orders is out of line.

                The current state of Gabriel is similar to what MEDUSA has described. For ~35 minutes now, and counting, Gabriel has not moved a centimeter in a sitting position in his cell.
                <br/><br/>
                I cannot help but agree with Colton, releasing Gabriel would be concerning, especially considering the suspiciously narrow time window within which both the MEDUSA individual and Gabriel have been found.
                <br/>
                Sharing such common traits while also arriving at similar times raises a clear question: Was this orchestrated? If it was, by what means? Our station is nearly 4000 kilometers away from MEDUSA.
                <br/><br/>
                As to not disturb the current order, we will release Gabriel shortly, while also providing updates.

                <br/><br/>
                Our subject identified himself as "Adam".<br/>
                Similarly to Gabriel, Adam measured completely normal body temperature upon entering the station.
                <br/><br/>
                This morning, Adam was found by the prison warden lying on his bed, imitating sleep. After checking the video footage, it seems that Adam switched from a sitting position to a lying position moments before the warden arrived.
                <br/>
                It has also been found that Adam doesn't respond to pain either.
                <br/>
                One thing to keep in mind is that the names "Adam" and "Gabriel" both hold strong Biblical connotations, which further raises the suspicion that this was an organized action, to an almost irrefutable level.
                <br/><br/>
                Following these revelations, MEDUSA committee has decided to veto APOLLON's decision to release Adam.
