                "Simultaneous risk of structural collapse"??<br/>
                There is no world in which a dozen buildings all experience a top floor structural collapse AT THE SAME TIME.
                <br/><br/>
                No further explanation, no visits from the CHB...<br/>
                It looks like the collegium is trying their hardest to keep this low profile
                <br/><br/>
                I'm a floor beneath the top floor and yet somehow I should not be concerned? Neither me nor anyone else on my floor got a visit from the CHB.
                <br/><br/>
                Not only is the collegium awfully quiet about all of this, but the overseer archived the last thread?<br/>
                This is deinitely not a case of structural collapse

                It might be far fetched to say this but, could it have something to do with the obscured torquish workstation threads?<br/>
                The threads are undeletable, meaning they have very high clearance. There sure is a basis for suspicion
